        <h2>We were granted Special Consultative Status with the United Nations in 1999, one of the first short-term volunteer organizations to do so. Through high-level associations, our international volunteer service work protects children’s security and welfare as we help eradicate hunger, improve health, and enhance cognition at the community level around the world.

For instance, we’ve taught English to entire villages, built schools, health clinics and water systems where there were none; cared for children who were living on the streets; supplied pregnant women and new mothers with household gardens and professional assistance, and so much more. Most important, we’ve proven that these people-to-people initiatives are successful where simply writing a check too often fails.

Measurable, positive outcomes in international volunteer service is our agenda. Short-term volunteer service teams provide an infinitely renewable resource to communities who invite our assistance.  This is why USA Today calls us the “granddaddy of the volunteer vacation movement.” Our international volunteer service expertise is our legacy – and your resource.
